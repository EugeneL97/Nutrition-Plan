# Bodybuilding Nutrition Plan App - Roadmap

## Vision
Build a practical, AI-assisted meal planning and tracking tool tailored for bodybuilders that focuses on sustainable adherence and fundamental optimization rather than perfection. The tool should provide personalized meal plans while tracking real-world adaptations, sleep quality, and digestion to help users make informed adjustments.

## 1. Core Features (MVP)

### Daily Tracking System
- **Morning logging**: Weight, sleep hours, wake time, previous day's digestion rating (1-5)
- **Meal confirmation**: Ask users if they ate exactly as planned, made substitutions, or skipped meals
- **Substitution tracking**: Automatic macro recalculation when users substitute foods
- **Digestion tracking**: Daily overall rating (1-5) based on gas, stomach upset, sleep disruption
- **Flexible meal timing**: Adapt to user's actual schedule with peri-workout priority

### AI Meal Plan Generation
- Generate base meal plans based on user inputs (goals, preferences, restrictions)
- Allow users to confirm or request changes before finalizing
- Adjust plans based on weight trends and adherence patterns
- Provide substitution suggestions from user's preferred foods database

### Smart Schedule Integration
- Input typical weekly schedule (work, gym, sleep times)
- Auto-generate meal timing with peri-workout nutrition priority
- Allow manual adjustments for schedule changes
- Handle exceptions gracefully (working late = larger meals, traveling = mindful eating)

### Optimal Score Dashboard
- **Primary factors**: Sleep quantity/quality, digestion ratings, macro adherence
- **Secondary factors**: Weight consistency within goal ranges, meal timing adherence
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized by impact (sleep issues first, then digestion, then weight trends)
- **Data visualization**: Daily scores, weekly trends, sleep patterns, digestion patterns

### User Experience Levels
- **Beginner**: More flexible tracking, larger acceptable ranges, educational content
- **Intermediate**: Standard tracking with moderate precision requirements
- **Advanced**: Rigid tracking for users who know their bodies well

## 2. Advanced Features (Future)

### Intelligent Pattern Recognition
- **Digestion analysis**: Correlate poor ratings with specific foods over time
- **Sleep pattern analysis**: Identify optimal sleep windows and hygiene factors
- **Weight trend analysis**: Distinguish between water weight and actual fat loss/gain
- **Adherence pattern recognition**: Identify common substitution patterns and preferences

### Smart Recommendations
- **Sleep hygiene**: Personalized recommendations based on sleep patterns
- **Food substitutions**: Suggest alternatives for foods causing digestive issues
- **Calorie adjustments**: Automatic recommendations based on weight trends and goal adherence
- **Meal timing optimization**: Adjust based on workout schedule and recovery patterns

### Integration & Automation
- **Google Calendar integration**: Auto-sync schedule for busy professionals
- **Smart notifications**: Meal reminders, sleep tracking prompts, weekly check-ins
- **Progress photos**: Optional tracking for visual progress assessment
- **Coach/client dashboard**: Multi-user support for online coaches

### Contest Prep Features
- **Progressive calorie reduction**: Automated adjustments over contest prep timeline
- **Peak week protocols**: Specialized meal timing and water manipulation
- **Carb cycling**: High/low day meal plans based on training schedule
- **Strict adherence mode**: Reduced flexibility for contest prep phase

## 3. Technical Implementation

### AI Prompt Engineering
- Generate meal plans with clear macro targets
- Provide substitution suggestions with macro equivalents
- Adapt plans based on user feedback and adherence patterns
- Parse and validate AI output for accuracy

### Data Architecture
- **User preferences database**: Track preferred foods, substitutions, restrictions
- **Digestion correlation engine**: Identify problematic foods over time
- **Sleep pattern analysis**: Track consistency and quality metrics
- **Weight trend analysis**: Distinguish between water weight and actual changes

### Mobile-First Design
- **Quick logging**: Easy morning weight and sleep entry
- **Meal confirmation**: Simple yes/substitution/skip options
- **Dashboard overview**: Clear optimal score and priority recommendations
- **Offline capability**: Basic tracking without internet connection

## 4. User Experience Flow

### Morning Routine
1. Log weight, sleep hours, wake time
2. Rate previous day's digestion (1-5)
3. Review today's meal plan and timing

### Throughout Day
1. Receive meal reminders based on schedule
2. Confirm meal consumption (exact/substitution/skip)
3. Log any spontaneous snacks or off-plan meals
4. Track substitutions with automatic macro recalculation

### Evening Review
1. Rate overall digestion for the day
2. Log any schedule changes for tomorrow
3. Review adherence and make adjustments if needed

### Weekly Assessment
1. Review weight trends and goal progress
2. Analyze sleep and digestion patterns
3. Adjust meal plan based on AI recommendations
4. Set priorities for the following week

## Design Philosophy

The app emphasizes **sustainable adherence over perfection**, recognizing that bodybuilders need practical solutions that work in real-world scenarios. The focus is on fundamental optimization (sleep, digestion, basic adherence) rather than micromanagement, with intelligent systems that learn from user patterns to provide increasingly personalized recommendations.
