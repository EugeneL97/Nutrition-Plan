# Nutrition-Plan
The idea of a Nutrition Plan that auto generates based on your preferences is something I've been interested for in a long time. My background of bodybuilding helped familiarize me with the dieting process. I was tired of just eating chicken, broccoli, rice every day with no flair to it. A diet should be something tailored to every person's needs as that'll help their adherence to it which is the most vital thing for weight loss. If your diet is not sustainable for you, you will lack the results you want.

The goal with this project is to be a challenging solo project that aids in my ability to learn Software Engineering concepts and expand my coding knowledge, while reinforcing my knowledge in nutrition and kinesiology. These diets will range for those looking for general health to athletes looking to maximize all factors for their respective sport.
