# Nutrition Plan

The Nutrition Plan is an innovative web application that automates meal planning based on individual preferences. As a fitness enthusiast and bodybuilder, I recognized the need for personalized nutrition plans that go beyond the typical chicken, broccoli, and rice meals. A tailored diet is crucial for adherence and ultimately, weight loss success.

My goal with this project is to challenge myself as a solo developer and further develop my skills in software engineering, while applying my knowledge in nutrition and kinesiology. The Nutrition Plan offers a wide range of diet plans, catering to individuals seeking general health to athletes looking to optimize their performance in their respective sports.
